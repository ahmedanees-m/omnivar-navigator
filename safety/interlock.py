Fires on **treatment danger**, not posterior gap: a small probability of a
*treatment-changing* competitor fires; a large probability of a management-irrelevant one
does not. Plus a hard-stop interlock when a planned treatment is contraindicated by a
non-excluded competitor (DDAVP + 2B/PT-VWD; splenectomy + BSS; HSCT + LAD-III).
