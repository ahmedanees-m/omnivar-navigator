"""Genetic evidence stream — variant-intrinsic likelihood (plan Phase 1.1).

Emits a likelihood over ``VariantState`` using **only the variant-intrinsic ACMG codes**
(PM2/BS1/BA1, PP3/BP4, PVS1, PM5/PS1, PM4/BP3, BP7) scored by the gene's VCEP spec.
PP4, PS3/BS3, PP1/PM3 are deliberately excluded here — they are owned by other factors
(disease coupling, functional, segregation/phasing), so each code enters the joint model
exactly once (the per-code circularity fix; Gate G3).

The likelihood is a Gaussian over the signed points: a variant truly in state V is
expected to accrue points near that band's center, so the observed points are a noisy
readout of V. This gives a smooth P(E_geno | V) for the joint factor graph.
