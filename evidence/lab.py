"""Lab / functional evidence — the one factor that touches BOTH disease and variant
(plan Phase 1.3 / §3.1).

A functional result (flow %, RIPA pattern, aggregometry, factor activity, smear)
informs the disease (it fits one disease's predicted pattern) AND the variant (a
damaging functional result is PS3-grade evidence the variant is pathogenic). It is one
factor `P(E_func | D, V)`, so it is counted **once** — never added separately as PS3 and
as a disease feature. The variant side uses Brnich-2020 OddsPath-style strength.
