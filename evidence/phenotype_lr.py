"""Phenotype likelihood ratios with pertinent negatives (plan Phase 1.2; LIRICAL-style).

For each observed HPO feature, LR(term | disease) = freq(term | disease) / freq(term | bg).
A **pertinent negative** (an explicitly *absent* term, ``observed=False``) contributes
LR = (1 − freq(term | disease)) / (1 − freq(term | bg)) — so "no leukocytosis" argues
against LAD-III. Phenotype enters the joint model **once** (informing the disease); its
pull on the variant flows only through the disease→variant coupling (calibrated PP4).

``Disease.feature_lr[feature_id]`` holds ``(freq_in_disease, n_cases, pmid)`` — the
disease-conditional frequency (with provenance + sample size for the uncertainty layer).
