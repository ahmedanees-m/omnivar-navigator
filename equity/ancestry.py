"""Genetic-similarity (ancestry) inference (plan Phase 3, Step 3.1).

Infers a genetic-similarity group (NOT self-reported race/ethnicity) by projecting the
sample onto reference principal components, plus a confidence. The production path uses
``somalier``/``peddy`` over the VCF against a reference PC panel — these run inside a
tool image on the VM (Docker-only); this module defines the interface + result type and
a pure-Python projector used when PCs are already extracted, so the engine stays
testable without the tool.
