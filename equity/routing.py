"""Equitable-evidence routing (plan Phase 3, Step 3.2 / design §3.7).

In action selection, the engine penalizes actions whose only yield is a
low-reliability (ancestry-biased) code, and prefers ancestry-robust actions
(functional assays, segregation) for under-represented-ancestry patients — turning
the documented equity gap into a routing rule. Concretely relevant: Glanzmann / BSS /
LAD cohorts are enriched in consanguineous populations where allele-frequency
evidence is least reliable.
