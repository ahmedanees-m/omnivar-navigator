"""Evidence-reliability flags (plan Phase 3, Step 3.1).

Documented fact: non-European-ancestry patients receive VUS results 1.5–2x more
often, driven by the allele-frequency (PM2/BS1) and in-silico (PP3/BP4) codes being
trained on European-skewed data; functional (PS3/BS3) evidence is ancestry-equitable.

This module computes a reliability r in [0, 1] for ancestry-biased codes as a
function of group-specific reference data density / predictor training composition.
`r` multiplies the contribution's effective points in the ledger (the
`EvidenceContribution.reliability` field), surfacing the uncertainty explicitly
rather than silently trusting biased evidence.
