"""Partial-input mode (plan Phase 6b) — the equity-load-bearing feature.

The settings that most need disambiguation have the least complete structured input, so
usefulness cannot assume clean inputs. DISCERN runs on any subset of
{genetics, phenotype, labs} (the joint already handles empty streams) and quantifies what
each *missing* modality would add — making the cheapest decisive next observation the
feature that survives incomplete data.
