"""Free-text -> HPO extractor with pertinent-negative capture (plan Phase 8.1).

The legitimate LLM soft task: turn a clinical narrative into HPO terms, capturing both
**present** and **explicitly excluded** features (pertinent negatives — "no leukocytosis"
becomes an absent term, which the joint model uses against LAD-III). Output is validated
against the HPO ontology and confirmed by a human before it informs the verdict; the rule
engine, not the LLM, assigns the evidence weight.

The extractor is injectable; the default routes through llm/gateway (cloud Nemotron / Qwen).
