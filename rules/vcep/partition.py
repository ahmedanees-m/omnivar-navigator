"""Per-code ACMG partition — the deep circularity fix (plan Phase 1.1 / §A.1 / Gate G3).

A VCEP bottom-line label bundles PS3 (functional), PP4 (phenotype), PM3 (phasing),
PP1 (segregation) etc. — the very codes DISCERN owns in *other* factors. Consuming the
label would double-count them. Instead DISCERN decomposes the spec to per-code strengths
and routes **each code to exactly one owning factor**, so each code enters the joint
model once. VCEPs already organize into sub-teams of this exact shape, so the partition
is given.
