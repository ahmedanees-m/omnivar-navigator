"""Evidence-gap & conflict analysis (plan Phase 2.1 / design §4.1).

A VUS is an evidence deficit (not enough points either way) or an evidence conflict
(opposing codes). This module:
  * enumerates the *attainable* not-yet-applied codes (context- and mechanism-aware),
  * computes the points gap to a target classification, and
  * flags VUS-by-conflict (opposing applied codes) so the recommender targets a
    disambiguating action rather than just any point-adder.

Attainability is mechanism- and context-gated: PS2 only if parents are available;
PP1/BS4 only with an informative family; PM3 (recessive) needs phasing; PS3/BS3
only if a validated assay exists for the gene's mechanism.
