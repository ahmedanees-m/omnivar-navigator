"""Calibrated decide / abstain policy (plan Phase 4.2 / §A.4).

DISCERN returns a call **only** when justified; otherwise it says "undecidable — here is
the deciding observation." Abstain if the max posterior is below threshold, OR the
credible interval is too wide (sparse LRs), OR a management-divergent competitor is not
excluded (the link to the safety interlock). The headline safety metric is the
**confident-and-wrong rate** — measured in Phase 9.
