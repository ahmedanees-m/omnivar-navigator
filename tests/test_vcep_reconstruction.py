"""Gate G3 — VCEP reconstruction with no inflation (plan Phase 9.2 / §A.1).

Feeding the joint model the SAME variant-intrinsic evidence the VCEP had must reconstruct
the VCEP's variant classification, with no inflation from the bundled codes (PP4/PS3/PP1/
PM3) that DISCERN owns in other factors. Passing this is the precondition for trusting any
reclassification claim — it proves the per-code partition prevents double-counting.
