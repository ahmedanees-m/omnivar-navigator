"""Prioritizer adapter — candidate belief state (plan Step 1.8).

Normalizes the output of upstream gene/variant prioritizers (Exomiser, AI-MARRVEL,
optionally DeepRare) into a common ``CandidateSet``, and records cross-tool
disagreement — which is a *feature*: disagreement raises a human-review flag rather
than being silently accepted. These tools run in their own images / services; the
per-tool ranking is injected here.
