"""Retrospective journey replay (plan Step 6.2).

On cases where the *resolving action* is known (eRepo/EAHAD curated trails;
Solve-RD/UDN as managed access clears), test whether the engine's #1 recommended
action matches what actually resolved the case — and at lower predicted cost.

Managed-access cohorts (Solve-RD/UDN) are NOT on the v1 critical path (long DAC
timelines); this harness runs on any (recommended, resolving-action, cost) trail.
