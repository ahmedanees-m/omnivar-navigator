"""Core ablation — full system vs underlying-tools-only (plan Step 6.1, headline).

Paired comparison on identical cases: does the decision/orchestration layer add VUS
resolution and/or reduce cost/time over using the same tools WITHOUT it? Metrics +
paired statistics (McNemar on resolution, Wilcoxon on cost/time). **Pre-register
before running** (gate G4); report negatives honestly.
