"""Management-aware misdiagnosis-rescue (plan Phase 9.3) — honest case-control.

On documented **mislabelled** cases ("2B"->PT-VWD; "ITP"->BSS), does DISCERN flag the
danger from the **pre-correction** evidence (corrected label hidden, no leakage)? Reported
as small / not powered, pre-registered (Gate G6).
