"""ACMG combining-rule fidelity + per-code partition on real ClinGen ERepo (Tier A).

Runs on the REAL ClinGen Evidence Repository export, restricted to the DISCERN
bleeding-cluster genes. It reports FOUR falsifiable metrics (the earlier "no-inflation
rate" was a tautology - it summed the same points twice and returned 100% for any input -
and has been removed):

  1. acmg_combining_exact - given the experts' OWN applied codes, does the Tavtigian point
     engine reproduce the VCEP's bottom-line label? This validates the point values and
     banding ARITHMETIC only; it does NOT validate code assignment (the codes are given)
     nor the disease-variant coupling (no phenotype is present here).
  2. partition_coverage - every applied code is recognised and routed to exactly one
     owning factor (target: 1.0, zero unknown). This CAN fail - it flags any ACMG code the
     partition vocabulary does not cover - which is what makes it a real check.
  3. at-risk population + points routed out of the genetic stream - how many real variants
     carry codes owned by non-genetic factors (PP4/PS3/PP1/PM3/...) and how many points
     those move out of P(E_geno|V). This is exactly the evidence a tool consuming the
     VCEP's bottom-line label would double-count.
  4. inflation_prevented - among the at-risk variants, how many a naive all-codes genetic
     score would push into a HIGHER pathogenicity band than the intrinsic-only score (i.e.
     how often the moved evidence was band-determining). Expect this to be modest; that is
     the honest result. (The coupling's empirical payoff is unprovable on ERepo - there is
     no paired phenotype to double-count against - and is a cohort result, not this one.)
